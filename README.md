Based on the high-level goal and the coding task description, the following components are needed:

1. `run.py`: This is the entry point of the program. It will access the Github account, create or update the repository, analyze other projects, extract and optimize code blocks, remove unnecessary dependencies, use various LLMs, communicate progress, and update deployment notes.

2. `github.py`: This module will contain the Github class to interact with Github API. It will handle tasks such as accessing the Github account, creating or updating repositories, and analyzing other projects.

3. `code_analyzer.py`: This module will contain the CodeAnalyzer class to analyze and optimize code blocks. It will extract the best-performing code blocks, resolve conflicts, and optimize the code.

4. `llm.py`: This module will contain the LLM class to use various LLMs. It will document which LLM was used for which task.

5. `progress_notes.txt`: This is the external file to communicate progress, challenges, and future-optimization ideas.

6. `deployment_notes.txt`: This is the external file to update steps for Docker/Digital Ocean setup.

7. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the Python dependencies needed for this project.

Here is the content of each file:

`run.py`
